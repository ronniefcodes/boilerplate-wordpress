# boilerplate-wordpress
This is meant to be a very barebones starting point for WordPress themes.

Includes:
- Webpack configuration to output JS and CSS files from `/client`
- Built-in SASS functions and mixins for clearfix, getting font sizes and setting media breakpoints (with variable breakpoints)
- Adding functions to handle adding theme support
- Functions and example code for pre-populating pages and menu items
- Very, very basic templates (based on html5blank)
